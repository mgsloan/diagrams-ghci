Editable Haskell expression yielding live-updating diagrams.

All of the code except src/Main.hs aren't mine and come from the following
sources:

  - Hint by Daniel Gorin. For some reason beyond me Hint builds / installs
    yet refuses to be visible to GHC due to package issues.  So for now it's
    included.

  - ActiveHs by Péter Diviánszky.  This is included because you can't use
    an application as a library!  Also because of the Hint business.
